# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for predicting customer churn using machine learning models. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers cease their relationship with a company or business. Predicting churn is essential for businesses to proactively retain customers and reduce revenue loss.

## Introduction

Customer churn prediction is a machine learning task that involves analyzing historical customer data to build predictive models. In this project, we focus on using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting classifiers to predict customer churn based on various features such as demographic information, transactional data, and interaction history with the business.

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/customer-churn-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd customer-churn-prediction
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to train and evaluate the models:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook churn_prediction.ipynb
Data
The dataset used in this project contains historical data about customers, including demographic information, transactional data, and interaction history with the business. You can find the dataset in the data/ directory.

Models
We explore three different machine learning models for customer churn prediction:

Random Forest Classifier
Logistic Regression
Gradient Boosting Classifier
Each model is trained and evaluated using standard machine learning practices.

Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of each model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we visualize the results using confusion matrices and ROC curves to provide insights into model performance.
